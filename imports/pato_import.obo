def: "Q1 has_part Q2 if and only if: every instance of Q1 is a quality_of an entity that has_quality some Q2." [PATOC:CJM]
comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.
