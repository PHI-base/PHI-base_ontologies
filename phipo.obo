name: immune response phenotype

comment: should this be here in host phenotype or in PHI? \na host gene mutation may alter a immune reponse (turn on or off) in the absence of the pathogen. should this be captured in the conditions in similar manner to pathogen penetration phenotypes. Or should it be duplicated in PHI with different prefixes 'host' and 'PHI'?
