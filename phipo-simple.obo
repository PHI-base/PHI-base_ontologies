comment: These terms need to be thought about further. Need to capture whether source of DNA, RNA, Protein, carbohydrate is from the pathogen or the host???\nPerhaps duplication is required to capture source from both.

def: "Definition from GO programmed cell death.\nA process which begins when a cell receives an internal or external signal and activates a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway). The process ends with the death of the cell. Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children, which are descendants of GO:0034050 'host programmed cell death induced by symbiont'."

def: "Definition from GO necrotic cell death.\nA type of cell death that is morphologically characterized by an increasingly translucent cytoplasm, swelling of organelles, minor ultrastructural modifications of the nucleus (specifically, dilatation of the nuclear membrane and condensation of chromatin into small, irregular, circumscribed patches) and increased cell volume (oncosis), culminating in the disruption of the plasma membrane and subsequent loss of intracellular contents. Necrotic cells do not fragment into discrete corpses as their apoptotic counterparts do. Moreover, their nuclei remain intact and can aggregate and accumulate in necrotic tissues. Note that the word necrosis has been widely used in earlier literature to describe forms of cell death which are now known by more precise terms, such as apoptosis. Necrosis can occur in a regulated fashion, involving a precise sequence of signals; in this case, consider annotating to GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or to its more specific child GO:0070266 'necroptotic process'."
